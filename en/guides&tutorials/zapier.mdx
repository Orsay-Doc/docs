**You need to connect Zapier to Orsay if you are getting leads from elsewhere, for example, Facebook ads, landing pages, etc., and you want to contact them via WhatsApp with Orsay.
Each time you get a lead, there is a zap that runs and sends us the lead information so we can contact them directly.**

## Here is the process:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Access Orsay Integrations:

- Go to the **Integrations** menu.
- Click **Connect Zapier**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose the Lead Source

- **Facebook Lead Ads (form)**
- **ClickFunnels page**
- **system.io form**
- **Any other compatible platform**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Orsay Action

- Select **Create Lead for Sequence** (recommended, so each lead is added directly into a specific sequence).
  <img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="/image_zapier/4.png" />
- **PS:** You can get a sequence ID by clicking next to the sequence name here

  <img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="/image_zapier/5.png" />

- Map the fields according to what you defined in Step 1.
- The available fields include:
  - **First Name**

  - **Phone Number**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Assign to Organization and Sequence

- Select the relevant **Organization**.
- Choose the **Sequence** where the lead should be added.

  and be placed into the right WhatsApp sequence.
