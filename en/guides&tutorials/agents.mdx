## Create Agents

**When you start building your AI agent on Orsay.ai, you’ll see two options. Think of them like two different paths:**

### 1 - Custom Prompt Agent:

The **Custom Prompt Agent**, where you write detailed instructions to shape the agent’s behavior. This gives you more control, but it’s better suited for advanced users.

### 2 - Guided AI Agent Setup:

The **Guided AI Setup** is quick and beginner-friendly. You just answer a few questions and your agent is ready. For most users, the guided option is the easiest and recommended.

1. **Click on “GUIDED AI AGENT SETUP”**
2. **Fill in the agent details**:
   - **Agent name**: Give your agent a recognizable name (e.g., “Rico Coolz”)
   - **Agent personality**: Lets you choose a preset personality for your agent. For example, “Man 25yo – Confident, Resourceful, Determined, Charismatic”
   - **Agent language**: Choose the main language for the agent’s responses
   - **Business description (1 sentence)**: Provide a brief description of your business so the agent can reference it when interacting with leads
   - **Your business offer**: Describe what you’d like the AI to pitch or highlight (e.g., product, service, special promotion) and share everything you want the AI to know about your offer
   - **Qualification questions**: List questions your agent should ask the leads for qualification (e.g., current situation, budget, interest). Click on + if you want to add multiple questions
   - **Call strategy**: Specify whether the agent should check if the lead agrees to a callback or invite them to book a call directly (**Booking call link is required**). It's about choosing between passive follow-up or active scheduling
   - **Emoji frequency**: Control how often the agent uses emojis (we recommend 25%)
   - **Emoji list (optional)**: You can choose the emojis your agent will use in its responses
   - **Directness**: Determine whether the agent’s tone is more empathetic or more direct (**0 = empathetic, 10 = highly direct for more calls**, we recommend 2)
3. **Click on “Save draft”** and **“Publish agent” (top right)** to finalize and add it to your list

### Editing Agents

You can modify an agent’s details at any time to better suit your needs:

1. **Locate the agent** in the list on the **Agents** page
2. **Click the ellipsis (three dots)** next to the agent’s name
3. **Select “Edit”**: You’ll be taken to the same form used to create the agent
   <img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="/image_agents/4.png" />
4. **Make your changes**: Adjust any fields, such as agent name, personality, language, or strategy
5. **Click “Publish agent”**: The agent’s configuration will update accordingly
   <img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="/image_agents/5.png" />

**While editing, you can also preview the agent to verify the conversation flow (Conversation test).**
