## Warm-up Process (only for outbound)

To ensure your account is fully secure, we have a comprehensive warm-up process to make sure we comply with all Instagram rules and keep your account safe at all times.

- **Warm-up period (without DMs): 3‚Äì5 days**
- **Ramping-up phase (we will progressively go from 5 DMs/day to 80 DMs/day): ~3 weeks**

If at any time your account is disconnected on Instagram, just send a DM to your support partner, and we will make sure your account runs smoothly. We have put this process in place to ensure we don't automatically relaunch new campaigns and avoid spamming Instagram.

During the process, you may receive an email from us asking you to reconnect your Instagram account or log in to your Instagram account, especially during the warm-up phase. This is expected and completely normal.

Every time you receive this email, please send us a message so we can help you reconnect your account and make sure everything is running smoothly.

## Outbound (max 50 DMs/day)

With this, the goal is to let the AI look at all the recent leads that either:

- **Liked one of your posts**
- **Followed you**
- **Liked a post of one of your competitors**
- **Followed one of your competitors.**

The AI will then review their profile to make sure they are qualified for you, and if they are, we will send them a DM.

For each step, we will always look at the most recent leads, for example, the last person who followed you, and so on.
